This is the official code repository of AMUSE (*Automated MUltiscale Simulation Environment*), a workflow for developing multiscale models for heterogenous catalytic reactions, involving density functional theory (DFT), microkinetic modeling and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). ChemRxiv preprint: [link](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-zms3n)

The repo contains AutoProfLib and pyMKM Python libraries. Within each package, different Jupyter notebooks are available as tutorials and in order to generate the published results.


## Dependencies

We provide an `environment.yml` file containing the dependencies needed to create the Conda environment for running AMUSE tests.
