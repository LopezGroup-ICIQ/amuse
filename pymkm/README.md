## Pymkm
Pymkm is a package for developing microkinetic models for heterogeneous catalytic systems.
Main usage of pymkm involves:
- Thermal catalysis: steady-state reaction rates, surface covergaes, apparent activation energy and reaction orders, descriptor search via degree of rate control and reversibility analysis.
- Electrocatalysis: steady-state current density, Tafel plots.

The main strength of pymkm is in its user-frienly way to generate information, since it is mainly based on two Python classes: mkm and electromkm, for thermal and electrocatalytic system respectively. The input that must be provided in order to build the model consists of two pieces: a reaction mechanism representing the global processes occurring in the system, and the reaction energetics, typically obtained by DFT calculations.
